# master-thesis

This repository contains all the codes for my master's thesis.

## How to see and share this repo
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andreamortaro/master-thesis/main)

In order to see my Jupyter Notebooks I built a Docker image of this repo making the hosted notebooks interactive.

You can find it [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andreamortaro/master-thesis/main) or click on the above badge.

Otherwise you can render my notebooks by using nbviewer, but the code in the link is not executable: [nb_viewer of my repo](https://nbviewer.org/github/andreamortaro/master-thesis/tree/main/).
